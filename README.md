# SocialPredict

## The open prediction market engine for everyone

SocialPredict lets **anyone** – individuals, classrooms, companies, and even governments – tap into the power of prediction markets.

- ✅ **Easy to deploy** – one project, one environment, a clean path from demo to production.  
- ✅ **Robust by design** – battle-tested economics, clear math, and a growing feature set.  
- ✅ **Truly open** – completely free, **MIT-licensed**, and built to be extended.

Our mission is simple:

> **To be the best open-source prediction market by far,  
> and to democratize the math behind forecasting.**

Prediction markets should not live in privatized, siloed, mystified platforms.  
SocialPredict is our push to bring them into the open: understandable, self-hostable, and usable by anyone who wants to ask better questions and get better answers.

No question is too small (or too big). You can forecast:

- Will a project ship on time?
- How many customers will join a new product beta?
- What policy choice will perform better over the next year?

Spin up your own instance and you have a **living, breathing forecasting surface** for your team, class, or community.

## Roadmap at a Glance

We’re building SocialPredict as the **best free prediction-market infrastructure** you can run yourself — today and ten years from now.
