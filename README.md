# About SocialPredict

## Empowering Communities with Domain-Specific Insights

Have you heard of Prediction Markets?

### Efficiency through Community Engagement

SocialPredict is Open Source Software Which:

- Embraces the open-source ethos, making our platform free for anyone to deploy under the MIT License.

### Domain-Specific Prediction Markets

Imagine a prediction market platform tailored to specific interests, for example, photography and cameras:

- An admin runs a photographers-and-industry-specialists-only prediction market platform.
- Discussions and bets on technology predictions, specific to photography and adjacent technology.

### Community Empowering Mission

We strive to:

- Empower communities to predict outcomes efficiently.
