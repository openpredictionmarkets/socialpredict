# Dynamic Go Version Matrix Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the dynamic Go version matrix system for CI/CD as outlined in CHECKPOINT20251008-01.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Matrix Preparation Job
- Added `prepare-matrix` job that dynamically builds Go version matrix at runtime
- Sources versions from `.github/go-versions` file or defaults to `file:backend/go.mod`
- Supports both explicit versions (`1.25.x`) and file references (`file:backend/go.mod`)

### 2. Updated Unit Testing Structure
- Replaced static unit job with `unit_matrix` that uses dynamic matrix
- Added stable aggregate `unit` job for consistent branch protection
- Maintained all existing conditional logic for branch types

### 3. Go Version Configuration File
- Created `.github/go-versions` with `file:backend/go.mod` as default
- Includes commented examples for adding additional versions
- Easy to modify without touching workflow files

## Required GitHub Settings Update

**IMPORTANT:** You need to update branch protection settings in GitHub:

### Steps:
1. Go to GitHub repository: `socialpredict`
2. Navigate to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Branches** ‚Üí **Branch protection rule for main**
3. Under **Require status checks to pass before merging**:
   - ‚úÖ **Add:** `Backend / unit (pull_request)`
   - üóëÔ∏è **Remove any existing version-specific checks** like:
     - `unit (1.23.x)`
     - `unit (1.25.x)` 
     - Any other versioned unit checks
4. **Keep other existing checks** (e.g., CodeQL, smoke tests)

## Benefits

### ‚úÖ No More Branch Protection Breakage
- Branch protection now uses stable `Backend / unit (pull_request)` check name
- Adding/removing Go versions won't break branch protection anymore

### ‚úÖ Flexible Version Management
- Edit `.github/go-versions` to add/remove test versions
- No workflow file changes required for version updates
- Supports both explicit versions and go.mod file references

### ‚úÖ Follows Project Conventions
- Defaults to Go version declared in `backend/go.mod` (currently 1.23.1)
- Can easily test against multiple versions when needed

## Usage Examples

### To test current go.mod version only (default):
```
file:backend/go.mod
```

### To test multiple specific versions:
```
1.25.x
1.26.x
```

### To test go.mod version plus additional versions:
```
file:backend/go.mod
1.25.x
1.26.x
```

## Migration Notes

- The system will default to testing the version specified in `backend/go.mod` if no `.github/go-versions` file exists
- Current setup uses Go 1.23.1 (from go.mod) which will be tested by default
- The smoke test still uses static `1.25.x` - this can be updated separately if needed

## File Changes Made

1. **`.github/workflows/backend.yml`** - Updated with dynamic matrix system
2. **`.github/go-versions`** - New configuration file for version management
3. **`README/CI_MATRIX_UPDATE.md`** - This documentation
