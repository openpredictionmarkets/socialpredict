What’s going wrong
The payout path that handlers/markets/resolvemarket.go still follows for CPMM markets (calculateDBPMPayouts) simply credits each winner with the raw number of winning shares:

go
Copy
Edit
if market.ResolutionResult == "YES" {
    winningShares = pos.YesSharesOwned
} else if market.ResolutionResult == "NO" {
    winningShares = pos.NoSharesOwned
}
if winningShares > 0 {
    usersHandlers.ApplyTransactionToUser(pos.Username, winningShares, db, usersHandlers.TransactionWin)
}
combined_all

Because the function never scales those shares against the total market volume, every winner just gets back exactly what they put in, and the pot contributed by the losing side is left undistributed. From the user’s point of view that looks like “the losers got refunded.”

Your newer, unit-tested payout engine in handlers/math/payout/resolvemarketcore.go does the right thing:

it calls CalculateMarketPositions_WPAM_DBPM, which assigns each user a cash value (0 for losers, >0 for winners),

then adjusts the values so that their sum exactly equals the market volume,

and finally credits pos.Value to each winner:

go
Copy
Edit
for _, pos := range displayPositions {
    if pos.Value > 0 {
        usersHandlers.ApplyTransactionToUser(pos.Username, pos.Value, db, usersHandlers.TransactionWin)
    }
}
combined_all

Two simple ways to fix it
Option	What to do	Pros	Cons
A. Retire the legacy path	Delete distributePayouts / calculateDBPMPayouts and always call payout.DistributePayoutsWithRefund from the HTTP handler.	One canonical implementation; already covered by tests	Requires updating any code that still calls the old helpers (mainly older tests)
B. Patch calculateDBPMPayouts	Keep the function but add a scaling step so each winning share is paid volume / totalWinningShares.	Minimal surface-area change	Duplicates logic that already exists in math/payout, easy to drift over time

Recommended: Option A
The math package is already battle-tested and cleanly separated from HTTP. Switching the HTTP handler to it keeps the single-source-of-truth principle you asked for.

diff
Copy
Edit
// handlers/markets/resolvemarket.go

- // Handle payouts (if applicable)
- err = payout.DistributePayoutsWithRefund(&market, db)
+ // Handle payouts (YES/NO proportional, N/A refund) – single canonical path
+ err = payout.DistributePayoutsWithRefund(&market, db)
  if err != nil {
      http.Error(w, "Error distributing payouts: "+err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
      return
  }

- // (delete distributePayouts and calculateDBPMPayouts)
Then remove the now-dead distributePayouts and calculateDBPMPayouts helpers and update tests to call the new path.
