* The problem we're trying to fix here is that when deployed to production, on the front end, if we visit an endpoint such as:

https://domain.com/markets

It gives a 404 error.

However if we go to:

https://domain.com/

...and then navigate to /markets, it's fine, no 404 error.

Also, if we go to a page such as domain.com/markets/1 and then click on the market creator in the upper left of the page, it also gives a 404.

However no other navigation buttons seem to give this anywhere else.

Where this button should lead is, for example:

domain.com/user/{USERNAME}

Now, if we visit that directly, e.g, domain.com/user/{USERNAME}, it gives the user's public profile as expected.

Also, if we visit this from below under the bets or positions module, it successfully navigates with no 402 Error.

Again, this is a problem under the production build, which can be found under scripts/

To be a bit more clear, all of this runs on docker.

I suspect there is something wrong with how react is serving things and this has nothing to do with the back end.

For the purposes of this task, it would be nice to just code it up and then hand it back over to a tester, rather than trying to test the code written.

There are lots of complicated things going on and the fact that this has to be deployed to prod to really test out makes executing commands on local inadaquate for testing and finalizing this code.

As far as writing react based tests, we haven't gotten into that so it's not necessary to follow all of the testing concerns mentioned in the conventions and testing conventions. We have been following that for our backend/ not our frontend/ for the timg being.
