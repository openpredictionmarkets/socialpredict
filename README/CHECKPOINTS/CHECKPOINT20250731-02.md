# üìú Project Plan ‚Äî Integrate **MaxDustPerSale** Config + Dust-Cap Logic  
Executor: **Cline (Claude-Sonnet 4)** ‚Äî can edit code, run tests.  
Target branch to merge into **main**: `fix/sellingFixes-resolutionDust`

---

## 1. Objective
1. Add a configurable **`maxDustPerSale`** setting to `setup.yaml` and Go structs.  
2. Enforce that cap inside sell-core logic; if a trade would exceed it, return HTTP 422 with a detailed JSON error.  
3. Maintain strict volume conservation and keep core logic separate from HTTP handlers.

---

## 2. Work Breakdown

| # | Task | Key Files / Commands | Acceptance Notes |
|---|------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1 | **Add YAML field** | `setup/setup.yaml` | Under `economics.betting`, add `maxDustPerSale: 2` (int64; 0 disables cap). |
| 2 | **Extend structs** | `setup/setup.go` | In `Betting` struct add:<br>`MaxDustPerSale int64 \`yaml:"maxDustPerSale"\``. Ensure parent `Economics` embeds the new field. |
| 3 | **Update test helper** | `models/modelstesting/generate.go` | In `GenerateEconomicConfig` set `MaxDustPerSale: 2`. |
| 4 | **Move helper** | Promote `GetMarketDust` ‚Üí `handlers/math/market/dust.go`; add GoDoc. |
| 5 | **Cap logic in sell core** | `handlers/bets/sellpositioncore.go` (or equivalent) | ```go\ncap := cfg.Economics.Betting.MaxDustPerSale\nrequested := proceedsExact - proceedsInt64\nif requested > cap {\n    return nil, payout.ErrDustCapExceeded{Cap: cap, Requested: requested}\n}\n``` |
| 6 | **Define error type** | `handlers/bets/errors.go` | `ErrDustCapExceeded` with fields `Cap`, `Requested`; implement `Error() string`. |
| 7 | **HTTP mapping** | `handlers/bets/sellpositionhandler.go` | On `ErrDustCapExceeded` ‚Üí `w.WriteHeader(422)` and JSON:<br>`{error:"dust_cap_exceeded",cap,xwould_be_dust,message}` with advice to ‚Äúreduce trade size to avoid dust fees.‚Äù |
| 8 | **Unit tests** | `handlers/bets/sell_dust_test.go` | ‚Ä¢ Success: dust ‚â§ cap.<br>‚Ä¢ Failure: cap exceeded ‚Üí 422, JSON matches.<br>‚Ä¢ Invariant: Œ£ balances == initial volume. |
| 9 | **Docs** | `handlers/bets/README_SELL.md` | Update flowchart + explanation of `maxDustPerSale` & 422 path. |
| 10 | **Sanity & merge** | `go vet ./...`<br>`go test ./...` | All tests green; push branch for review / merge into **main**. |

---

## 3. Structured Error Payload

```json
HTTP 422
{
  "error": "dust_cap_exceeded",
  "cap": 2,
  "would_be_dust": 5,
  "message": "Trade would incur 5 dust points (cap 2). Reduce sell amount or split into smaller trades to avoid dust fees."
}
4. Acceptance Criteria
maxDustPerSale parsed from YAML and accessible via cfg.Economics.Betting.MaxDustPerSale.

Any sell: dust ‚â§ cap; else returns 422 with payload above.

Total currency invariant across all tests.

No breaking changes to existing successful API calls or schemas.

--- Further Reflection Conversation

I've analyzed the codebase and your project plan for implementing MaxDustPerSale configuration and dust-cap logic. This is a well-structured plan that follows your coding conventions perfectly. Here's my analysis and proposed approach:

## Current State Assessment

__‚úÖ What's Already in Place:__

- Robust configuration system in `setup.yaml` and `setup.go` with singleton pattern
- Selling infrastructure with `ProcessSellRequest` in `sellpositioncore.go`
- Higher-order function pattern in `SellPositionHandler` with `EconConfigLoader` dependency injection
- Test infrastructure with `GenerateEconomicConfig` helper
- Dust calculation placeholder (commented out): `// dust := redeemRequest.Amount - actualSaleValue`

__üîß What Needs Implementation:__

- `maxDustPerSale` field in config structures
- Dust cap enforcement logic
- Custom error type `ErrDustCapExceeded`
- HTTP 422 error mapping with structured JSON
- Comprehensive unit tests

## Implementation Strategy

The plan is excellent and follows your conventions perfectly. Here's my proposed execution order:

### Phase 1: Configuration Foundation (Tasks 1-3)

1. __YAML Config:__ Add `maxDustPerSale: 2` under `economics.betting`
2. __Go Structs:__ Add `MaxDustPerSale int64` to `Betting` struct
3. __Test Helper:__ Update `GenerateEconomicConfig` with `MaxDustPerSale: 2`

### Phase 2: Core Logic (Tasks 4-5)

4. __Dust Calculation:__ Create proper `GetMarketDust` function in `handlers/math/market/dust.go`
5. __Cap Enforcement:__ Add dust cap logic in `calculateSharesToSell` function

### Phase 3: Error Handling (Tasks 6-7)

6. __Error Type:__ Create `ErrDustCapExceeded` with `Cap` and `Requested` fields
7. __HTTP Mapping:__ Update handler to return HTTP 422 with structured JSON

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (Tasks 8-10)

8. __Unit Tests:__ Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases
9. __Documentation:__ Update `README_SELL.md` with flowchart
10. __Integration:__ Full test suite validation

## Key Technical Decisions

__‚úÖ Excellent Design Choices in Your Plan:__

- Using `int64` for precision (follows "Points Start with Integers" convention)
- Higher-order function pattern for dependency injection
- HTTP 422 for business rule violation (not technical error)
- Structured JSON error response with helpful messaging
- Separation of concerns (math logic vs HTTP handling)

__üéØ Critical Implementation Points:__

- The dust calculation: `dust = requestedAmount - actualSaleValue`
- Cap check: `if dustAmount > cfg.Economics.Betting.MaxDustPerSale`
- Volume conservation must be maintained throughout
- Error should provide actionable advice to users

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this plan? The approach is solid and follows all your coding conventions perfectly.

OK well basically as long as it's understood that we're not changing the model, and that all of this is based off of the bets model, which is already in int64, and this is all stateless.

Thinking:The user is confirming the key architectural principles that need to be maintained: 1. **No model changes** - We're not modifying the database schema or the Bet model structure 2. **Based off the bets model** - All calculations use the existing int64 amounts from the Bet model 3. **All stateless** - Following the "Ab Initio" principle where everything is calculated from the ledger of bets This is perfect alignment with their coding conventions. The dust cap feature will be: - A business logic layer that sits on top of the existing stateless bet processing - Uses the existing int64 amounts (no floats) - Calculates dust as the remainder between requested amount and actual payout - Enforces the cap without changing underlying data structures I should confirm my understanding and ask if they want me to proceed with implementation.‚Äé

Perfect! I completely understand the architectural constraints and they align perfectly with your "Ab Initio" principle and existing conventions:

## ‚úÖ Confirmed Design Principles

__üîí No Model Changes:__

- Zero modifications to the `models.Bet` struct or database schema
- All existing `int64` fields remain unchanged
- No new database columns or tables

__üìä Stateless & Bet-Based:__

- All dust calculations derived from existing bet ledger
- Dust = `requestedAmount - actualSaleValue` (both int64 from bet processing)
- Volume conservation maintained through existing stateless calculations
- Everything calculated ab initio from the bet history

__üéØ Pure Business Logic Layer:__

- `maxDustPerSale` config setting controls business rules only
- Cap enforcement happens in the selling logic before bet creation
- HTTP 422 response prevents the transaction entirely (no partial states)
- Existing successful sells remain completely unchanged

## Implementation Flow

```go
// In calculateSharesToSell() - existing function
sharesToSell := creditsToSell / valuePerShare
actualSaleValue := sharesToSell * valuePerShare
dust := creditsToSell - actualSaleValue  // This is the "leftover"

// New cap check
if dust > cfg.Economics.Betting.MaxDustPerSale {
    return ErrDustCapExceeded{Cap: cap, Requested: dust}
}
```

The beauty is this adds a protective guard rail without changing any of the core mathematical or data persistence logic. All the existing stateless calculations continue to work exactly as they do now.

Should I toggle to

Act Mode (‚åò‚áßA) and implement this following the 10-task plan?

Right, OK so in calculating dust, that might create a double for loop, because we have to calculate potential dust on each sale I believe ... so to calculate dust, we need to use some kind of stack or special algorithm which would not create exponential time.

API Request$0.0403

Thinking:The user is pointing out a critical performance consideration. They're saying that to calculate dust, we might need to loop through all existing sales to calculate the accumulated dust for a user or market, and then we'd need to do this calculation for each potential sale request, which could create O(n¬≤) time complexity. Let me think about this: 1. Current selling logic in `calculateSharesToSell()` calculates dust for just the current transaction: `dust = creditsToSell - actualSaleValue` 2. But the user seems to be thinking about accumulated dust across multiple sales, not just per-sale dust. 3. If we need to track total dust across all sales for a user/market, then yes, we'd need to: - Loop through all previous sales to calculate accumulated dust - Then for each new sale request, do that calculation again - This could indeed be O(n¬≤) if not handled efficiently 4. The solution would be to use some kind of efficient algorithm - maybe: - Caching/memoization of dust calculations - Stack-based accumulation - Single-pass algorithm - Or maybe the dust cap is per-transaction, not cumulative? I need to understand what the user means by "calculate potential dust on each sale" - are they talking about: - Per-transaction dust limits? - Cumulative dust limits across all sales? - Something else? Let me ask for clarification about the exact dust calculation requirement.‚Äé

Ah, excellent point about algorithmic complexity! I need to clarify the dust calculation scope to design the right algorithm.

## ü§î Dust Calculation Scope Question

Are we talking about:

__Option A:__ __Per-Transaction Dust Cap__

```go
// Simple O(1) - just this sale
dust := requestedAmount - actualSaleValue
if dust > maxDustPerSale { return error }
```

__Option B:__ __Cumulative User Dust Cap__

```go
// O(n) risk - need to sum all previous dust for this user
totalUserDust := calculateAllPreviousDustForUser(username, marketID)
newDust := requestedAmount - actualSaleValue
if totalUserDust + newDust > maxDustPerSale { return error }
```

__Option C:__ __Market-Wide Dust Cap__

```go
// O(n) risk - need to sum all dust across all users in market
totalMarketDust := calculateAllDustInMarket(marketID)
newDust := requestedAmount - actualSaleValue  
if totalMarketDust + newDust > maxDustPerSale { return error }
```

## ‚ö° Performance Solutions

If it's cumulative (B or C), we could use:

- __Cached aggregation:__ Store running dust totals, update incrementally
- __Single-pass stack algorithm:__ Process bets chronologically once
- __Index-based lookup:__ Pre-compute dust totals during market position calculations

Which dust calculation scope did you have in mind? That will determine whether we need the more sophisticated algorithms.

Yeah, we're talking about a per transaction dust cap, however what happens to the dust after it's calculated? This needs to be a seperate function, right? So at some point we need to calculate the market volume. The dust should go into the market volume, which affects the price, so there is additional complexity in the volume calculation here, otherwise we're not accounting for all currency in the game.

Thinking:The user is making a crucial point about accounting for the dust that's retained when transactions occur. This is about the conservation of currency principle - if someone requests to sell 100 points but only gets paid out 98 points (leaving 2 dust), that 2 points doesn't just disappear - it should remain in the market volume and affect pricing. This is a deeper architectural consideration than just checking if dust exceeds the cap. We need to: 1. Calculate the dust (requestedAmount - actualSaleValue) 2. Check if dust <= maxDustPerSale cap (reject with 422 if not) 3. Account for the dust in market volume calculations The dust becomes part of the market's total volume that affects pricing, but it's not paid out to users. This maintains the ab initio principle - all currency is accounted for when calculating market state. This means we need: - A function to calculate dust per transaction (O(1)) - Market volume calculation functions that account for accumulated dust - Proper separation of concerns between transaction validation and market math Let me confirm this understanding and outline the architectural approach.‚Äé

Perfect! You've identified the crucial currency conservation issue. This is more sophisticated than just capping dust - we need to ensure __total currency accountability__ in the system.

## üí∞ Currency Conservation Architecture

__The Problem:__

```go
// User wants to sell 100 points
requestedAmount := 100
actualSaleValue := 98  // Only get paid 98 (due to share granularity)
dust := 2              // 2 points "left behind"
```

__‚ùå Current Risk:__ Those 2 dust points could vanish from the economy __‚úÖ Required Solution:__ Dust stays in market volume, affects all future pricing

## üèóÔ∏è Proposed Architecture

### 1. __Transaction Level (O(1) - Simple)__

```go
func validateDustCap(requestedAmount, actualSaleValue, maxCap int64) error {
    dust := requestedAmount - actualSaleValue
    if dust > maxCap {
        return ErrDustCapExceeded{Cap: maxCap, Requested: dust}
    }
    return nil
}
```

### 2. __Market Volume Level (Separate Function)__

```go
func CalculateMarketVolumeWithDust(db *gorm.DB, marketID string) int64 {
    totalBetVolume := sumAllBetAmounts(marketID)
    totalDustRetained := calculateAccumulatedDust(marketID)
    return totalBetVolume + totalDustRetained
}
```

### 3. __Dust Accounting (Ab Initio from Bet Ledger)__

```go
func calculateAccumulatedDust(marketID string) int64 {
    // Single pass through all sell bets in market
    // For each sell: calculate what dust would have been retained
    // Sum all dust ‚Üí O(n) but only called when market volume needed
}
```

## üéØ Key Design Questions

__Where does market volume calculation currently happen?__ I should examine the existing volume/pricing functions to see where dust accounting needs to be integrated.

__Should dust calculation be cached or always computed ab initio?__ Following your conventions, probably ab initio for accuracy.

Should I examine the current market volume/pricing calculation functions to understand where to integrate dust accounting?

Look at how market volume is calculated. % tree | grep volume ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ marketvolume_test.go ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ marketvolume.go. ... See how that gets calculated and you can see that another function is needed to calculate volume WITH dust now, so currency doesn't get dropped from the economy. Dust calculation needs to be ab initio for accuracy, which again, brings up the time complexity problem.. .but if the algorithm for calculating dust within our volume calculation creates a, "stack," and stacks those dust calculations at each sale into its own list, it doesn't have to keep running through all transactions again and again, it can just go up the ladder and keep looking at the stack. Does that make sense? Please look at marketvolume.

Thinking:The user wants me to look at the marketvolume.go file to understand how market volume is calculated currently, so I can see where dust needs to be integrated. They're concerned about time complexity and suggest using a "stack" approach to avoid recalculating dust repeatedly. Let me read the marketvolume.go file first to understand the current implementation.‚Äé

Thinking:I can see the marketvolume.go file. Let me understand what's happening: 1. `GetMarketVolume(bets []models.Bet)` - sums up all bet amounts 2. `GetEndMarketVolume(bets []models.Bet)` - there's a bug here, it's calling itself recursively instead of calling GetMarketVolume, but the intent is to add subsidization The user is pointing out that we need a "stack" algorithm to calculate dust efficiently. The idea is: When calculating market volume, we need to account for dust that gets "left behind" in sell transactions. Currently, the volume calculation just sums bet amounts, but it doesn't account for the dust that should stay in the market. The user's suggestion about a "stack" algorithm makes sense: - When processing bets chronologically, for each sell bet, calculate what the dust would be - Instead of recalculating dust from scratch each time, build up a running total/stack - This avoids O(n¬≤) complexity by doing a single pass and maintaining state So we'd need a new function like: `GetMarketVolumeWithDust(bets []models.Bet)` that: 1. Processes bets in chronological order 2. For sell bets, calculates dust and adds it to a running total 3. Returns original volume + accumulated dust The "stack" concept means we maintain a running calculation as we go through the bets, rather than recalculating from scratch each time.‚Äé

API Request$0.0365

Thinking:Looking at the market volume calculation, I can see: 1. `GetMarketVolume(bets []models.Bet)` simply sums all bet amounts - both positive (buys) and negative (sells) 2. It handles negative amounts (sells) which reduce the total volume 3. There's also `GetEndMarketVolume` which adds subsidization Now I understand the problem! When someone sells shares, the current system: - User requests to sell 100 points worth - System calculates they can only get 98 points (due to share granularity) - The 2 "dust" points get lost from the economy entirely - The bet recorded is `-98` (the actual sale amount), not `-100` (what they requested) So the user's request for 100 points disappears, but only 98 points are actually transacted. Those 2 dust points are lost from the total economy. The "stack" algorithm the user is suggesting makes sense: - As we process bets chronologically, we can build up a running total of dust - For each sell bet, we calculate what the dust would have been - We maintain a "dust stack" that gets added to market volume calculations - This way we don't have to recalculate from scratch every time The key insight is that we need a new function `GetMarketVolumeWithDust()` that: 1. Calculates normal volume (sum of all bet amounts) 2. Calculates accumulated dust from all sell transactions 3. Returns volume + dust to preserve currency conservation The stack approach would work like: ```go func CalculateAccumulatedDust(bets []models.Bet) int64 { dustStack := make([]int64, 0) totalDust := int64(0) for _, bet := range bets { if bet.Amount < 0 { // This is a sell // Calculate what the dust would have been for this sell dust := calculateDustForSell(bet) dustStack = append(dustStack, dust) totalDust += dust } } return totalDust } ``` I see a clever way to track lost fractional points during sell transactions. By maintaining a running total of dust points, we can ensure no value is accidentally dropped from the economic system. The chronological processing means we capture every small fractional loss efficiently.‚Äé

Perfect! Now I understand the currency conservation issue and your stack algorithm approach. Looking at the market volume calculation:

## üîç Current Market Volume Logic

```go
func GetMarketVolume(bets []models.Bet) int64 {
    var totalVolume int64
    for _, bet := range bets {
        totalVolume += bet.Amount  // Sums positive buys + negative sells
    }
    return totalVolume
}
```

## üí∏ The Currency Loss Problem

__Current Flow:__

1. User requests: "Sell 100 points"
2. System calculates: "You can only get 98 points (due to shares)"
3. Bet recorded: `Amount: -98` (actual sale)
4. __Lost:__ 2 dust points vanish from economy

## üèóÔ∏è Stack Algorithm Solution

You're absolutely right - we need a __single-pass dust accumulation__ to avoid O(n¬≤):

```go
func GetMarketVolumeWithDust(bets []models.Bet) int64 {
    baseVolume := GetMarketVolume(bets)           // Current function
    accumulatedDust := calculateDustStack(bets)   // New O(n) function
    return baseVolume + accumulatedDust
}

func calculateDustStack(bets []models.Bet) int64 {
    dustStack := int64(0)
    
    for _, bet := range bets {
        if bet.Amount < 0 { // Sell transaction
            dust := calculateDustForThisSell(bet)
            dustStack += dust  // Add to running total
        }
    }
    return dustStack
}
```

## üéØ Key Questions:

1. __How do we reverse-engineer dust from existing sell bets?__ The bet only shows `-98`, but we need to figure out the original request was `100`.

2. __Where does the original requested amount get stored?__ We need it to calculate `dust = originalRequest - actualSale`.

Should I examine how sell requests currently work to understand what data we have available for dust calculation?

1. We need to have a consistent dust calculation mechanism, and we should be able to calculate the dust based upon all bets on the market up to that point of the sale. We don't need to look at the original amount, we just look at the actual sale, and then the dust that was calculated gets calculated from that.

API Request$0.0307

Thinking:The user is clarifying that we need to calculate dust based on the actual sale amount in the bet record, not trying to reverse-engineer the original request. This makes sense - we can calculate what the dust would have been based on the market state at the time of each sell transaction. So the algorithm would be: 1. Go through bets chronologically 2. For each sell bet (negative amount), calculate what the dust would have been at that point 3. This requires recalculating the market position and share values at each sell point 4. Stack up the dust amounts as we go This is still potentially O(n¬≤) if we're not careful, because for each sell bet, we need to know the market state at that time. But if we process chronologically and maintain running state, it could be O(n). Let me understand this better and respond.‚Äé

Ah, brilliant! Now I understand the __deterministic dust calculation__ approach. We can reconstruct dust ab initio from the bet ledger without needing the original request amounts.

## üßÆ Consistent Dust Calculation Algorithm

__The Key Insight:__ For any sell bet, we can calculate what the dust *would have been* by reconstructing the market state at that point in time.

```go
func calculateDustStack(bets []models.Bet) int64 {
    totalDust := int64(0)
    
    // Process bets chronologically (by PlacedAt timestamp)
    sortedBets := sortBetsByTime(bets)
    
    for i, bet := range sortedBets {
        if bet.Amount < 0 { // This is a sell
            // Calculate market state up to this point
            priorBets := sortedBets[:i]
            marketStateAtSell := calculateMarketPositions(priorBets)
            
            // Determine what dust would have been generated
            dust := calculateDustForSell(bet, marketStateAtSell)
            totalDust += dust
        }
    }
    
    return totalDust
}
```

## ‚ö° Stack Optimization Strategy

To avoid O(n¬≤), we maintain __running market state__:

- Process bets chronologically in one pass
- Maintain cumulative position/volume state as we go
- When we hit a sell, calculate dust based on current state
- Stack the dust amount and continue

This gives us O(n) with the "stack" being our running totals.

## üéØ Updated Architecture Plan

1. __Transaction-level:__ Cap check (simple)
2. __Market volume:__ `GetMarketVolumeWithDust()` uses dust stack
3. __Dust stack:__ Single-pass chronological calculation

Does this match your vision for the consistent, deterministic dust calculation?
