# Violations of SRP in /users/errors.go

The file bundles unrelated domain concerns into one place:

* ErrInsufficientBalance and ErrInvalidTransactionType mix transaction/wallet rules into a user-domain error file (errors.go), so the user package is handling transaction concerns.
* ErrInvalidCredentials/ErrUnauthorized are authentication/authorization concerns that likely belong to an auth boundary, not general user domain.
* User lifecycle/data errors (ErrUserNotFound, ErrUserAlreadyExists, ErrInvalidUserData) share the file with the above, so one module is owning user CRUD, auth, and transactional logic instead of a single responsibility.
