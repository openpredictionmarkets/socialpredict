Goal

When users visit /user/${Whatever} for some nonexisting user, show a page that says "No user found"

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can see how the current user profile system works and I've identified the issue with non-existent users.

## Current Flow Analysis

1. __Routing__: `/user/:username` route renders the `User` component
2. __Data Fetching__: User component fetches from `/v0/userinfo/:username` API endpoint
3. __Backend Logic__: `GetPublicUserInfo` does a database lookup - when no user exists, GORM returns an empty `User` struct with zero/empty fields
4. __Frontend Issue__: The User component only checks for `!userData` (loading state) but doesn't validate if the returned user data is actually valid

## Proposed Solution

__Modify the frontend User component to:__

- Validate that the returned user data is not empty/invalid (check username, ID, etc.)
- Show a "No user found" page instead of rendering empty profile data

__Implementation Details:__

1. __Add validation logic__ in `User.jsx` to check if user exists:

   ```jsx
   const isUserFound = userData && userData.username && userData.id !== 0;
   if (userData && !isUserFound) {
     return <UserNotFound username={username} />;
   }
   ```

2. __Create a `UserNotFound` component__ with styling consistent with the app and clear messaging

3. __Ensure the component handles the edge case__ where empty user data is returned by the API

## Benefits of This Approach

- __Minimal changes__ to the existing API (maintains backward compatibility)
- __Frontend-controlled__ user experience (easier to customize messaging)
- __Consistent error handling__ pattern with other app functionality
- __No backend changes required__ (avoids touching server-side logic)

Would you like me to proceed with implementing this solution? I can create the UserNotFound component and modify the User component accordingly.
