# Plan to split transaction/wallet rules from user-domain errors

Identify domain boundaries: separate user lifecycle/errors (not found, already exists, invalid user data) from auth (invalid credentials, unauthorized) and wallet/transaction (insufficient balance, invalid transaction type).
Create dedicated error files per boundary (e.g., errors.go and errors.go), moving the relevant constants and adjusting imports.
Update references: search codebase for the moved errors, switch to the new package paths/types, and ensure callers still compile.
Add lint/test pass: run unit tests or build to confirm no broken references; if tests lack coverage, add a minimal compile-time check or targeted unit tests for the new error locations.
Document the split: briefly note the new error locations and rationale in the domain README or inline comments where helpful.
