## The goal:

- Have users able to change the number of significant figures displayed on a stepped chart by editing setup.yaml (between 2 and 9 significant figures)
- Prediction market charts to display a variable number of significant figures (2-9) based on the user input in setup.yaml

## Step by step implementation

1) Modify setup.yaml so that users can set the number of significant figures in the market charts

2) Create a tiny helper that:

- fetches the yaml file

- parses it with our SocialPredict tools

- clamps the number of significant figures to the allowed range (2–9)

- provides a ready-to-use number formatter

3) Build a single formatting utility

4) Wire the formatter into your Chart.js options

Apply it to:

- Y-axis ticks (most common)

- Tooltip label (so hover values match the tick style)
