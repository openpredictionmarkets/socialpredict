`fakeUsersService` is a test stub that satisfies the full users.ServiceInterface so bet handler tests can run without calling real user logic.

It lives in `buypositionhandler_test.go` and `sellpositionhandler_test.go`.
Struct shape: only keeps user *dusers.User; no other state.
Behavior: returns the stored user from GetUser and no-op/zero values for every other method (transactions, profile updates, listings, credentials, etc.).
Purpose: lets the bet handlers assume a logged-in user exists while isolating the tests from real user service or DB interactions.
