### Separation of Concerns in /markets/service.go

At service.go (line 103), the interface mixes several concerns (creation, mutation, resolution, querying, projections/analytics). To separate responsibilities, split it into cohesive interfaces keyed to workflows:

* Creation/Mutation: MarketAuthoring with CreateMarket, SetCustomLabels, ResolveMarket.
* Read Models: MarketQueries with GetMarket, ListMarkets, ListByStatus, SearchMarkets, GetPublicMarket.
* Participant Views: MarketParticipantViews with GetMarketDetails, GetMarketBets, GetMarketPositions, GetUserPositionInMarket.
* Analytics/Calculations: MarketAnalytics with ProjectProbability and CalculateMarketVolume. 
* GetMarketLeaderboard should live in its own interface.
