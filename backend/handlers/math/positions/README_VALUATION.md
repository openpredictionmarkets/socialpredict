Step-by-step strategy:
Start from resolvemarketpayouts.go

Extract reusable computation steps into helper functions without changing behavior.

E.g., extract share-weighted value computation, rounding logic, and adjustment logic into isolated funcs.

Unit test payout behavior

Ensure AllocateWinningSharePool() works identically after refactor.

Snapshot-based test with fixed inputs and expected balance deltas.

Create a core computation module

Place reusable functions inside handlers/math/valuation/ or handlers/math/payoutcore/.

Allow both valuation.go and resolvemarket*.go to import these.

Refactor valuation.go to use shared logic

Replace duplicated logic in CalculateRoundedUserValuationsFromUserMarketPositions() with call to shared computation module.

Keep timestamp-based adjustment for rounding delta, unless reused directly.

Verify correctness

Confirm valuation results match payout results when resolution is YES or NO.

Also test behavior when resolving to a probability between 0.0 and 1.0.

üí° Future Cleanups
Move valuation.go out of positions/ and into math/valuation/.

Treat valuation as a view-layer for prediction markets:

Used in UI/API to preview potential or current value.

Not responsible for state mutation or transfers.

Final shared structure:

bash
Copy
Edit
handlers/
  math/
    payout/                  # Finalize payouts to users
    valuation/               # Compute user value at any point
    payoutcore.go           # Shared math used by both
